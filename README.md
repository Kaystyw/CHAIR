**Fashion Object Image Classification**
ðŸ“Œ NTU-IEM Module: Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (Jan 2023 â€“ Apr 2023)

**Project Overview**
This project focuses on image classification of fashion objects using machine learning techniques. Our goal was to analyze a dataset containing 50,000 high-resolution images of clothing items and build classification models to predict the correct category.

We implemented and compared multiple models, including:
âœ… **Convolutional Neural Network** (CNN) â€“ Achieved 94% accuracy
âœ… ****Support Vector Machine** (SVM)**
âœ… **Random Forest Classifier**

The CNN model demonstrated superior performance, reducing misclassification errors by 10% compared to other models.

Dataset
The dataset consists of 50,000 images of 10 different clothing categories.
Each image is labeled with the corresponding clothing type.
Data preprocessing included resizing, normalization, and augmentation to enhance model performance.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries & Frameworks:
TensorFlow / Keras (for CNN)
Scikit-learn (for SVM & Random Forest)
OpenCV & Matplotlib (for data visualization)
NumPy & Pandas (for data handling)
Project Workflow
Data Exploration & Preprocessing
Loaded and visualized the dataset
Applied normalization and augmentation techniques
Model Implementation
Trained CNN, SVM, and Random Forest models
Fine-tuned hyperparameters for optimal performance
Evaluation & Comparison
Measured accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
Compared results to identify the most efficient model
Final Results
CNN achieved the highest 94% accuracy
SVM and Random Forest had lower performance due to their inability to capture spatial patterns
Key Takeaways
âœ” Deep learning (CNN) outperforms traditional machine learning models for image classification.
âœ” Data preprocessing and augmentation significantly improve model accuracy.
âœ” Hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation are essential for optimizing classification performance.

Future Enhancements
ðŸ”¹ Expand dataset with more diverse fashion items
ðŸ”¹ Experiment with transfer learning (e.g., ResNet, VGG16) for further accuracy improvements
ðŸ”¹ Deploy the model as a web-based application for real-time classification
